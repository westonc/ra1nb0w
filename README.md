A puzzle game (&amp; experiment in comparing front-end approaches).

Last night while everyone was sleeping, aliens quietly invaded the earth and replaced all the numerals in the world with colors.

However, they weren't malevolent, just playful! So they left behind a modular addition table (and a single hint) which _you_ can use to decode which color belongs with which number.

That's the game. You can play it here:

This is also meant to be an experiment in taking a modest but reasonably complex front-end application from basic viablility to a state of more refined architecture and UX, documenting decisions faced and choices made along the way. 

v0 is a snapshot of the application in its basic viabile state.
